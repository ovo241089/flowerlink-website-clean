# Website Improvement Plan: FlowerLink

## Phase 1: Speed Optimization

- [ ] **JavaScript Optimization**
  - [ ] Identify and fix JavaScript errors.
  - [X] Minify JavaScript files (custom.js, main.js, product-menu.js minified).
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical JavaScript.
- [ ] **Image Optimization**
  - [X] Compress images without losing quality (PNGs optimized).
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for images.
  - [ ] Use responsive images (e.g., `<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute).
- [ ] **Caching Implementation**
  - [X] Implement browser caching for static assets (Web.config updated).
  - [ ] Configure server-side output caching for frequently accessed dynamic content.
- [ ] **Content Delivery**
  - [X] Minify CSS files (style.css minified).
  - [X] Enable Gzip compression for text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) (Web.config updated).
- [ ] **Database Optimization** (If applicable and access is provided)
  - [ ] Analyze and optimize slow database queries.
  - [ ] Ensure proper indexing on database tables.
- [ ] **Server Response Time**
  - [ ] Review server-side code for performance bottlenecks (ASP.NET specific).
- [ ] **Resolve Mixed Content Warnings**
  - [ ] Ensure all resources are loaded over HTTPS.

## Phase 2: Checkout Experience Enhancement

- [ ] **Streamline Checkout Flow**
  - [X] Analyze current multi-step form in Checkout.cshtml for simplification opportunities (Analysis complete; main steps: Message, Address, Delivery, Payment).
  - [X] Reduce the number of steps if possible without losing essential information (e.g., by combining Address and Delivery steps). (Address and Delivery steps combined in Checkout.cshtml).
  - [X] Ensure a clear visual progression through the checkout steps. (Progress bar HTML updated, JS logic verified for 3 steps).
- [ ] **Make Add-on Products Less Intrusive**
  - [X] Review _UpSellingModal.cshtml and its integration in Checkout.cshtml (Review complete; modal is triggered after adding to cart, content loaded via @Html.Action("UpSell", "Order")).
  - [X] Modify the presentation of upsells to be less disruptive (e.g., offer at the end of the main purchase or as a subtle suggestion). (Upsell section moved to Cart.cshtml, modal removed from checkout flow).
- [X] Improve form validation with clear error messages (HTML5 validation attributes and Bootstrap feedback messages added to all required fields in Checkout.cshtml).
- [X] Add progress indicators during checkout (if not already sufficient). (Existing progress bar with 3 steps verified as sufficient).
- [X] Implement guest checkout option (if not already fully functional or clear). (Existing "Continue as Guest" button in login modal allows proceeding without login, which is considered sufficient).
- [X] Optimize mobile checkout experience. (Reviewed responsive CSS in style.css and Checkout.cshtml, confirmed media queries and layout adjustments for mobile devices are in place. Further testing would require live deployment and device testing).

## Phase 3: Customer Order Tracking Backend

- [X] Design database schema for order tracking. (Detailed schema drafted in order_tracking_design.md).
- [X] Develop API endpoints for order status updates. (GetOrderStatus, GetOrderHistory, UpdateOrderStatus added to OrderController.cs; OrderTrackingViewModels.cs created).
- [X] Create customer account system (if not present or needs enhancement). (Existing AccountController.cs reviewed, basic login/registration and session management are in place. Sufficient for current order tracking needs).
- [X] Build order status tracking interface for customers. (TrackOrder.cshtml and OrderHistory.cshtml created with AJAX calls to backend APIs. Modal for order details in history page implemented).
- [X] Implement email notifications for order updates. (OrderController.cs updated to send emails on order confirmation and status changes).
- [ ] Add order history and details view for customers.
- [ ] Develop an admin interface for managing order statuses.

## Phase 4: Documentation and Review

- [ ] Create implementation documentation.
- [ ] Submit pull requests for review.
- [ ] Report and send implementation details to user.
